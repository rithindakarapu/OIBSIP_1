Explanation:

Recording Audio: The record_audio() function captures audio input from the microphone and saves it as a WAV file.
Transcribing Audio: The transcribe_audio() function sends the recorded audio to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for transcription.
Processing Text: The process_text() function uses spaCy to parse the transcribed text and extract entities (like locations) to determine the user's intent.
Getting Weather: The get_weather() function fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the extracted location.

Customization:

Add more intents and API integrations for tasks like sending emails or setting reminders.
Implement error handling and improve the NLP model for better accuracy.
Enhance user interaction with a graphical or voice feedback interface.
